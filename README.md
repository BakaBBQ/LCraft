#LCraft
An approach to RogueLike + Sandbox

###Basic Concepts
the basic concept of LCraft is based on Dwarf Fortress.
While the game starts, you need a world. The world will develop and you can pause the world at a certain time.
Then you can choose any of the auto-generated characters and control them in a rougelike + sandbox manner

###Development Status
Currently semi-active. Meaning that I will develop LCraft at least every two days

###Can I help with anything?
No. Basics are still being developed =-=.
