An Approach to Roguelike + Sandbox

Currently Using RPG Maker VX Ace

###Brief Intro
After playing several games like Minecraft, Elona and Dwarf Fortress. I started this project to include sandbox concepts (building, destroying), roguelike concepts (infinite dungeons and randomly generated weapons) and the amazing history generation in DF (I want to include history in this game).

###Current Version
In Dev 0.02

###Can I do something
No you can't. I am still developing the basics of LCraft :x
